# SonnenBatterie Control Flows with Node-RED

This repository contains Node-RED control flows I use for controlled charging and discharging, in my case with the help of Tibber dynamic pricing.

You can start with some background information, motivation and general ideas, then look at how "cheap Hours" are calculated (when does it make sense to charge or discharge) and then how this thing is configured...

Or you can jump directly to the [Overview](./docs/overview.md) and read up on the details later

1) [Background](./docs/background.md)
2) [How do we calculate what is "cheap"](./docs/calculation.md)
3) [Controlling Charging and Discharging](./docs/charging-discharging.md)
4) [Configuration (Tibber and SonnenBatterie)](./docs/configuration.md)


Have fun - and leave an issue or a note (in discussions) if you have a problem or an idea how things could be improved. Or, fork it and create a PR.

Either way - enjoy.

Cheers,

Markus
